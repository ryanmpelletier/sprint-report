Atlassian JIRA 6.2.2 Plugin
Sprint Report Plugin

This plugin allows users to specify queries to run which should be used to show sprint data on one of
two reports.

1. Sprint Time Report
The Sprint Time Report will show, for the selected project, all of the sprints, and the total amount of 
time which has been logged for those sprints.

2. Sprint User Time Report
The Sprint User Time Report will show, for the selected project, data about the logged work of users during
the different sprints of the project. The user can optionally input the name of a sprint, and the name of the user, 
to narrow search results.

Spring configuration can be changed in sprint-report/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/atlassian-spring.xml
-the user can change the queries being run
-the user can change the database driver
-the user can change the datasource

Any third-party class references in the Spring XML must have the jars for those classes put into
the sprint-report/src/main/resources/META-INF/lib directory
